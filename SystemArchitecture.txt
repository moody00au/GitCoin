System Architecture

Chrome Extension: The GitCoin Chrome extension is the primary user interface. It integrates with the user's GitHub account, offering an enhanced user interface overlay on 
GitHub's existing UI. This overlay displays gamified statistics and various options for users to interact with the GitCoin system. The extension will actively track user 
activity and interactions on GitHub, such as code commits, pull requests, issues created/closed, and comments made. The extension communicates this data to the GitCoin system.

GitHub API Integration: GitCoin uses the GitHub API to fetch user data and project data in real-time. It captures data about commits, comments, forks, stars, pull requests, 
issues, and other user-generated content. These data points serve as the basis for the token system. For example, creating a pull request might accrue a certain number of tokens, 
with additional tokens awarded if the pull request is accepted and merged. Comments on issues could also earn tokens, with more awarded for comments that lead to a resolution.

Token System & Blockchain Integration: Every GitHub user who interacts with GitCoin is assigned a blockchain wallet within the GitCoin system. Tokens earned from various GitHub 
activities are stored in this wallet. The more meaningful the contribution (i.e., code commits, pull requests, issue resolution), the more tokens earned. Users can then use these 
tokens to incentivize other contributors, by assigning tasks or bounties on specific issues or features. All token transactions and reputation changes are tracked and securely stored 
on the blockchain, maintaining transparency and security.

AI Guidance System: At the heart of GitCoin is an AI system that guides users through the gamified landscape of open-source contribution. It uses machine learning to analyze a user's 
activity on GitHub and suggests actions to earn more tokens. For instance, if a user frequently commits to a specific repository or comments on specific types of issues, the AI might
suggest similar repositories or issues to contribute to. Over time, the AI learns from the user's behavior and preferences, providing increasingly personalized guidance and 
recommendations.

Virtuous Cycle Component: The interaction between the token economy, the reputation system (built on the blockchain), and the AI creates a self-sustaining loop: higher-quality 
contributions earn more tokens, which improves a user's reputation, which in turn influences the AI's guidance. This feedback loop encourages continuous improvement and growth.

By using the GitCoin Chrome extension, any user or observer can get a real-time estimate of tokens accrued by a GitHub user based on their public profile and projects. 
The extension can provide a breakdown of tokens earned per project, per type of contribution, and an overall total. This token system, in turn, stimulates a more active and productive open-source community on GitHub.
