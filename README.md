Gamifying and tokenizing open-source development through a powerful blend of AI, blockchain technology, and a Chrome extension

Welcome to GitCoin, a transformative Chrome extension concept designed to revolutionize the way we contribute to open-source software development. By integrating AI, blockchain technology, and gamification, GitCoin aims to foster a vibrant and rewarding ecosystem for open-source contributions.

Overview

GitCoin is more than just a project, it's a catalyst for an open-source paradigm shift. Think of it like a seed that contains the instructions to grow into a tree, and every contribution you make is like a new seed that adds to the growth and strength of GitCoin, and the open source code landscape. This isn't just about creating code, it's about changing the way we value and incentivize open-source development, and we want you to be part of this exciting journey.

Gitcoin effectively gamifies and tokenises the value of people's contributions to the GitHub database and creates a marketplace ecosystem that rewards contribution and collaboration, while representing that value in a blockchain system.  

System Architecture is in the file systemarchitecture.txt in the repo. 

How to Contribute
Just like a seed carries the blueprint for a tree, our system architecture serves as the foundation for for the GitCoin ecosystem. But we need your help to bring this idea to life. Here's how you can contribute:

Break down system specs: We invite you to delve into the system architecture and help us dissect it into smaller, manageable issues. Each issue represents a challenge that needs to be addressed for GitCoin to grow.

Convert the tasks into issues on the repo: Once an issue is defined, we need your help to translate it into specific tasks that can be tackled with code.

Code: Select a task, write the code, and make a pull request. Your contribution is another seed that helps GitCoin to grow and thrive!

Join Us
GitCoin is an ever-evolving project. We're continually refining the system and exploring new ways to gamify and incentivize open-source contributions. But we can't do it alone.

We invite developers, innovators, and enthusiasts to join us. Whether you're making your first open-source contribution or you're a seasoned developer, there's a place for you in the GitCoin community.

Help us grow GitCoin from a seed into a mighty tree. Together, we can revolutionize how we value and incentivize open-source development!

Future Developments
As GitHub already incorporates some gamification features, GitCoin will explore these and other potential functions to add depth to the system. Future enhancements will focus on improving the tokenization component, refining the AI guidance system, and expanding the gamification functions. This continuous development aims to drive the virtuous cycle, making GitCoin an ever-evolving and improving system for open-source contributions.

This high-level architecture serves as the foundation for GitCoin. As development progresses, more detailed specifications will be provided for each component. We encourage contributors to join us in making GitCoin a reality, revolutionizing how we value and incentivize open-source development.
